#These programs work on the dataset available on mendeley: https://data.mendeley.com/drafts/j948jp2r5f
#Step 1 is to run the Python code also on this page
#Step 2	is a SQL aggregation
CREATE TABLE countBy as 
SELECT count(*) as Msg_Count, count(distinct ICAO) as Concurrent
FROM times 
GROUP BY timePeriod;
#Step 3	is a SQL aggregation
CREATE TABLE Rt as
SELECT Concurrent, avg(Msg_Count) as Msg_Rate
FROM countBy
GROUP BY Concurrent;
#Step 4	is a SQL aggregation
CREATE TABLE Rp as
SELECT Concurrent, Msg_Rate/Concurrent
FROM Rt;
